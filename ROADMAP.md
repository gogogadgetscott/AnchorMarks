2. Rich Card Previews (OG Image Support)
The current UI relies heavily on favicons.

The Idea: Implement "Card View" with OpenGraph thumbnails. When a bookmark is added, we should fetch and display its hero image.
Benefit: This makes the dashboard more visual and easier to scan, similar to Pinterest or a modern news feed.
3. Glassmorphic Surface Effects
To add depth and a premium feel:

The Idea: Use backdrop-filter: blur(12px) on the sidebar and the new user menu dropdown.
Benefit: This gives the app a modern "OS-level" feel, making it look sleek and integrated with the user's environment.
4. Interactive Command Palette (Omnibar)
The search bar should be more than just search.

The Idea: Merge the Search Bar and Command Palette. When the user clicks the search bar, it expands into a full "Command + K" interface with recent searches, suggested tags, and quick actions.
Benefit: It reduces cognitive load by providing a single point of entry for all navigation and discovery.

6. Breadcrumb Navigation
For users with deeply nested folders:

The Idea: Show the folder path (e.g., Work > Projects > Q4 Cleanup) in the header next to the view title.
Benefit: Provides instant context and easy "pop-back" navigation.
